# happy day?
I met the TEDx Organizer. I met him after a long time, so it was a lot of fun. I like him very much.
After that, I met a friend. I ate Thai cuisine and went home. I am reading the wizard of Oz in English now.

I was told by the fortune teller about shocking things. I am a little hurt. But I think it is a fact. And that is important.
