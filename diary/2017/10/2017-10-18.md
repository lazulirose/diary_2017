# I called my friend

I talked after a long absence. I sat on the stone wall of the temple and called.
Because it was raining, I took shelter from the rain under a tree.

I talked about Japanese medical care and suicide. A doctor 's friend said that euthanasia should be adopted. I think so, too.
Because there are few religion in Japan. Unlike overseas, there is no religion.
