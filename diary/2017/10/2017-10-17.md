# What is happiness of every world?

I talked to a French friend tonight. It's about every world and happiness.
She said "I want to live in the forest", so I asked for details. "I want simple happiness"
Ah agrey. I can understand it, so I felt a lot of empathy. Because I was thinking as well. 

But maybe so the solution is different for us.
After all, does wonder we essentially have to change ourselves? Because of the needs of many worlds. Sometimes I feel it. Hmm, It is difficult for us to live.
